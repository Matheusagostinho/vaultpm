# Vault Roadmap

The full plan from today's alpha to a **genuinely functional and distributable**
1.0 package manager. Checked boxes are implemented and tested **today**.

**Legend:** `[x]` done · `[~]` partial · `[ ]` todo

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations ✅ (done)

- [x] Cargo workspace (`crates/cli`, `crates/core`)
- [x] `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, clippy-clean, `cargo fmt`
- [x] Error model (`thiserror` in core, typed `VaultError`)
- [x] Async runtime (Tokio) + `reqwest` (rustls, no OpenSSL system dep)
- [x] Unit test suite (18 tests) running in CI
- [x] MIT license, `.gitignore`, `rust-toolchain.toml`

## Phase 1 — MVP install pipeline ✅ (done)

- [x] CLI with `clap`: `install`/`i`, `add`, `remove`/`rm`, `audit`, `run` (stub)
- [x] `vt` alias as a first-class second binary
- [x] Global flags: `--dir`, `--production`, `--force`
- [x] npm registry client with in-memory packument cache
- [x] Dependency resolution (pragmatic **flat** resolver — see Phase 4 for PubGrub)
- [x] Parallel tarball download (bounded concurrency)
- [x] **SHA-512 integrity verification (fail-closed)**
- [x] Content-addressable store at `~/.vault/store` (per-file dedup)
- [x] `node_modules` materialization via **hard links** (copy fallback)
- [x] `vault.lock` generation with per-package security verdict
- [x] `vault.toml` config parsing with secure defaults
- [x] Real end-to-end install verified against the live npm registry

## Phase 2 — Security layer (depth)

- [x] **OSV.dev CVE lookup** + policy gate (`abort_on_critical_cve`)
- [x] Static scan of `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` (pattern-based)
- [x] Audit runs on **metadata, before any download/extract**
- [x] Colored terminal security report
- [x] **Maintainer-takeover signal**: recency check (resolved version published
      within `warn_new_maintainer_days`) + maintainer count, on direct deps
- [x] **Low-popularity warning** via npm downloads API (`min_weekly_downloads`)
- [x] Offline integration tests covering the fixture scenarios
      (`clean`, `postinstall-network`, `postinstall-ssh`, `postinstall-env`)
- [ ] `swc`-based **AST** analysis of scripts (resists obfuscation that beats regex)
- [ ] npm Advisory API as a second CVE source
- [ ] Full maintainer-diff (compare against last-seen maintainer set, not just recency)
- [ ] Reputation checks on transitive deps (currently direct-only to bound API calls)
- [ ] Persistent audit cache (`audit.json` per content hash, TTL from config)
- [ ] Typosquatting heuristic (edit-distance vs popular package names)

## Phase 3 — Sandbox & provenance

- [ ] **Landlock sandbox** (Linux ≥ 5.13) for approved lifecycle scripts
- [ ] Permission policy from `vault.toml` (fs read/write/exec, net allowlist)
- [ ] Approved-script execution model with interactive allowlist prompt
- [ ] Graceful fallback (explicit warning) on kernels without Landlock
- [ ] **Sigstore provenance** verification of npm attestations
- [ ] `--strict` mode (require provenance; treat warnings as blocks)
- [ ] macOS sandbox via `sandbox-exec` profile (parity, best-effort)

## Phase 4 — Correctness & performance (to truly rival pnpm)

- [ ] **PubGrub SAT resolver** replacing the flat resolver (proper conflict handling)
- [ ] **pnpm-style isolated layout** (`node_modules/.vault` virtual store + symlinks)
- [ ] Peer-dependency resolution + warnings
- [ ] Optional / dev / bundled dependency semantics
- [ ] `.bin/` linking for package executables
- [ ] **Lockfile-driven installs** (respect existing `vault.lock`; `--frozen-lockfile`)
- [ ] Workspaces / monorepo support (`workspaces` field, filtering)
- [ ] Sandboxed execution of trusted lifecycle scripts (depends on Phase 3)
- [ ] Store garbage collection (`vault store prune`) + offline mode
- [ ] Download resume/retry, integrity-failure quarantine
- [ ] Benchmarks vs npm / pnpm / bun (cold + warm cache)

## Phase 5 — Distribution & platforms

- [x] npm package `vaultpm` via **optionalDependencies** (zero install scripts)
- [x] `curl | sh` installer (`install.sh`)
- [x] GitHub Actions **CI** (fmt + clippy + test on Linux/macOS/Windows)
- [x] GitHub Actions **Release** pipeline (build matrix → tarballs + npm publish)
- [x] `build-npm-packages.mjs` to assemble per-platform packages in CI
- [ ] Reserve npm org `@vaultpm` and publish the first `0.1.0` release
- [ ] Publish `vault-core` + `vault-cli` to **crates.io**
- [ ] **Windows support** 🪟
  - [ ] Verify build on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` in CI (matrix already present)
  - [ ] Windows path / reserved-filename handling in store + linker
  - [ ] No-Landlock fallback path (sandbox disabled with warning)
  - [ ] `.cmd` / `.ps1` bin shims; junctions instead of symlinks where needed
  - [ ] `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` (ARM) target + `@vaultpm/win32-arm64`
  - [ ] `.zip` release asset wired into a `install.ps1` PowerShell installer
- [ ] Verify Linux `aarch64` cross-build end-to-end
- [ ] Homebrew tap (`brew install vault`)
- [ ] Shell completions (zsh/bash/fish) + man pages
- [ ] **Dogfood:** sign Vault's own releases with SLSA/Sigstore provenance

## Phase 6 — DX & community

- [ ] `vt why <pkg>` — explain why a package is in the tree
- [ ] `vt licenses` — license report
- [ ] `vt outdated` / `vt update`
- [ ] Progress bars (`indicatif`) for resolve/download/link
- [ ] `.npmrc` compatibility (registry mirrors, scoped registries, auth tokens)
- [ ] Private registry + authentication support
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue/PR templates
- [ ] Telemetry-free by design statement + threat model doc

## Definition of "really functional & distributable" (1.0 bar)

1. **Installs correctly:** PubGrub resolver + isolated layout + lockfile-driven,
   handles real-world graphs (Phase 4).
2. **Secure by default:** CVE gate, AST script analysis, maintainer-takeover
   detection, and a working Landlock sandbox (Phases 2–3).
3. **Cross-platform:** Linux (x64/arm64), macOS (x64/arm64), Windows (x64)
   binaries published and tested in CI (Phase 5).
4. **One-command install everywhere:** `npm i -g vaultpm`, `curl | sh`,
   `cargo install`, Homebrew (Phase 5).
5. **Trustworthy:** Vault's own releases carry provenance; threat model and
   security policy are public (Phases 5–6).

**Where we are now:** Phases 0–1 complete; Phase 2 substantially started (CVE
gate + static scan live); distribution scaffolding (Phase 5) in place and ready
for the first publish. Next up: Phase 2 depth, then the Phase 4 resolver.
